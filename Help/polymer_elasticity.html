		<h1> Polymer Elasticity v2.2.0 </h1>
		

		<h2>General</h2>
			<p> 
				The <i>polymer_elasticity</i> script can be used to fit the Model of the extended, freely jointed Chain 
				to Results of Force-Clamp Experiments. The Model is as follows  
				<a href = "single_chain_afm_force_spectroscopy.pdf">[Gianotti 2007]</a>:
			</p>
			
			<p lang = "latex">
				z(F) = Lc \cdot \left\{ coth\left(\frac{F~l_K}{k_B~T} \right) - \frac{k_B~T}{F~l_K} \right\} \cdot
				\left( 1 + \frac{F}{K_S~l_K} \right)
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Where $z(F)$ represents the force-dependent Expansion of the measured Molecule and $F$ represents the Force applied in z-Direction to the Molecule. 
				The free Parameters of the Model are:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><p>$K_S:$ Segment Elasticity in $Nm^{-1}$</p></li>
				<li><p>$L_C:$ Contourlength in $m$</p></li>
				<li><p>$l_K:$ Kuhnlength in $m$</p></li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				The Constant Parameters are the Boltzmann Constant $k_B$ as well as the absolut Temperature $T$. This Model is fitted to the plotted inverse Function
				(Distance vs. Force) within the Data Range selected in <i>polymer_elasticity</i>.
			</p>

		<h2><a href = "#top" id = "user_guide">User Guide</a></h2>
			<p>
				Before any Force-Curve can be evaluated, make sure that the following points are met:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The <i>Utility Function Labrary</i> must persist on the MATLAB path</li>
				<li>A Python Interpreter must have been determined in MATLAB (see MATLAB doc for <code>pyversion</code>)</li>
				<li>MATLABs current Folder is the Folder where all the Files for <i>polymer_elasticity</i> are located (normally: .../polymer_elasticity)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				For <i>polymer_elasticity</i> the key Variable is <code>DataSelection</code>. Basically <code>DataSelection</code> can be created in various ways. 
				The easiest way maybe slicing through an nx2 MATLAB-Vector representing any Graph with x and y coordinates. However, if someone doesn´t want to wirte
				his own piece of code for importing Force-Curves from a File, the common way to produce <code>DataSelection</code> would be through the Program <i>Kraftkurven</i>.
			</p>
		
			<h3> <a href = "#top" id = "start_program">Start of the Program</a></h3>
				<p>
					To start the Script <i>polymer_elasticity</i>, there are two ways:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Type <i>polymer_elasticity</i> in the MATLAB-Command Window</li>
					<li>Open the Script <i>polymer_elasticity</i> in the MATLAB-Editor and Click "Run" or press "F5"</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					What follows is the Opening of a Figure called "Polymer Elasticity" and the Creation of an empty Axes together with several Gui-Elements
					(for more Details about the Gui-Elements, see the Section <a href = "#miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</a>).
				</p>
				
			<h3><a href = "#top" id = "load_curves">Load Force-Curves from Text-Files</a></h3>
				<p>
					To import Force-Curves from Text-Files, the MATLAB-App <i>Kraftkurven</i> gets utilized. To open this App, go to the Menu Point "Polymer Elasticity" in the Figures Menu Band and 
					Click on "Open Kraftkurven". Next, hit the "Load"-Button and choose a folder where appropriate Text-Files are located. Make sure, that the Text-Files meet the following 
					Points:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The Text-Files are Exported from the "JPK Data Processing"-Software (version 5 or later) from Bruker (formally known as JPK Instruments AG)</li>
					<li>Export the Text-Files with full header settings</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					For Force-Clamp-Experiments it might be advantageous to choose the option "retrace" in the "Curve Segments to Plot"-Dropdown Menu. This Option shows only the part
					with the Clamp-Event of the exported Force-Curves. To use the <i>freely jointed chain</i> Model, the default Values in the Dropdown Menus for x- and y-channels should
					remain untouched.
				</p>
			
			<h3><a href = "#top" id = "create_dataselection">Create the Variable <code>DataSelection</code></a></h3>
				<p>
				If the Force-Curves loaded properly, MATLABs Plot Tools together with a Figure, showing all Force-Curves loacated in the chosen Folder, would open. In order to created
				<code>DataSelection</code>, follow the next Steps:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Right-click on <b>any</b> of the staggered Graphs and choose "Graphen Staffeln" (in the "Offset"-Dialog just hit "Ok")</li>
					<li>Right-click on a <b>certain</b> Graph, which should be evaluated and hit the Menu Point "Öffne Graph in neuer Abbildung"</li>
					<li>In the new Figure disable all Figure Tools</li>
					<li>Right-click on the white space around the Graph</li>
					<li>Choose a specific Selection Type and mark the Region on the Graph which is related to the Extension of a Polymer</li>
					<li>Right-click on the selected Data Range and hit "To Workspace" to create <code>DataSelection</code> in MATLABs base Workspace</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					In the Base-Workspace of MATLAB the following Variables should now exist:
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt><b>Data</b></dt>
						<dd>- Structure with Program specific Data created from <i>polymer_elasticity</i></dd>
					<dt><b>Gui_Elements</b></dt>
						<dd>- Structure with Gui_Elements created from <i>polymer_elasticity</i></dd>
					<dt><b>ForceCurves</b></dt>
						<dd>- Stucture with all loaded Force-Curves from <i>Kraftkurven</i></dd>
					<dt><b>DataSelection</b></dt>
						<dd>- nx2 MATLAB-Vector describing the Region of Interest of a Force-Curve, created via <i>Kraftkurven</i></dd>
				</dl>
			
			<h3><a href = "#top" id = "fit_model">Fit the Model to the loaded Dataset</a></h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Hit the Button "Reimport DataSelection" to show <code>DataSelection</code> in <i>polymer_elasticity</i></li>
					<li>Choose an appropriate Starting Point for the Clamp-Event either by Left-clicking on a Point on the Graph or by entering a Value in the xoffset/ yoffset cells 
					in the Table (where it sys "NaN" at the beginning)</li>
					<li>Chose an appropriate Fit Range for the Model. This can be done either by hitting the Button "New Fit Range" and dragging an Region of Interest or by
					entering Values for the Cells "Xl" and "Xr" (Where it says "NaN" at the beginning)</li>
					<li>If the Fit doesn´t start automatically, hit the Button "DoFit" on the Slide-Panel (">>"-Button)</li>
				</ol>
			
			<h3><a href = "#top" id = "adjust_parameter">Adjusting the Fit Parameters</a></h3>
				<p>
					If the Default-Values for the Fit were inappropriate, the Parameters for the Fit would be adapted in the slide-panel. The Slide-Panel is, at the beginning, hidden behind the 
					Button ">>". Initial Values for the Fit can be adjusted by entering new Start Values for variable and constant Parameter directly to the "Value"-Columns of the Variable- and 
					Constant-Parameter Tables. Additionally, variable Parameter can be fixed at a certain Value by checking the Box "hold" for the corresponding Parameter. This specific Parameter remains untouched 
					during the Fit. By default, the variable Parameters $K_S$ and $L_C$ are fixed at the initial Values, $l_K$ remains free (constant Parameters are fixed per definition and can´t 
					be changed to variable ones). If Values were entered to the Tables (this is valid for all tables), the Fit must be reevaluated by pressing the "DoFit"-Button.
				</p>

			<h3><a href = "#top" id = "load_data">Load new Data</a></h3>
				<p>
					If the Data in the Variable <code>DataSelection</code> changes, it´s necessary to reimport the Data to <i>polymer_elasticity</i>, by pressing the Button called
					"Reimport DataSelection". Thereafter the new Graph will appear in the Figure. All Offsets, Fit Ranges and Fit Representations will be deleted.
				</p>
			<h3><a href = "#top" id = "delete_fitrange">Delete the Fit Range</a></h3>
				<p>
					To delete the actual Fit Range, press the Button "Delete Fit Range". This will only delete the Fit Range and the Fit Representation. All Offsets remain unchanged.
				</p>
			<h3><a href = "#top" id = "save_figure">Save Figure Elements</a></h3>
				<p>
					To get a "good looking" Version of the Elements in the Figure, right-click on the white Background of the Figure. in the Context Menu choose "Save Figure" and 
					MATLABs Plot Tools will open.
				</p>
